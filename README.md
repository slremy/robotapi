# robotapi

This repo provides some very simple examples of the use of the httpget clients to control a networked robot.
Both open and closed-loop interaction is quite possible, and the infrastructure has been used with control intervals 
(over the Internet) of 50ms between locations in EST and and MT. 

Current examples are for use with https://github.com/slremy/ros_web_service.git
